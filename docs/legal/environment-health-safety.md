* Improve environmental and energy performance by identifying environmental aspects, threats, and opportunities, and the conservation of natural resources, waste minimization, and prevention of pollution.
* Identify and comply with LuzFaltex standards associated with management of EHS and sustainability.
* Integrate EHS and sustainability aspects into business processes, from planning through execution.

## Acting Sustainably

* Establish goals, objectives, targets, and periodic reviews in all areas related to the management of EHS and sustainability to drive continual improvement.
