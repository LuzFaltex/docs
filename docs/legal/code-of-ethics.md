# LuzFaltex Code of Ethics

Todo: Insert letter from CEO here.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is no right way to do a wrong thing.

## The Way We Work

This code applies to app employees, officers, directors, and volunteers ("employees") of LuzFaltex LLC and its subsidiaries ("LuzFaltex" or the "Company"). As employees of LuzFaltex, we will comply with all laws, regulations, and Company policies that govern our activities around the world. To do any less would compromise our shared values. We will strive to be involved and responsible citizens in the communities where we live. At work, we will deal with employees fairly and honestly, and with a concern for safety and well being.

Management is responsible for making sure that proper attention is given to, and that controls are in place for, promoting compliance with our code of conduct and the specific Company policies addressing each area. Employees who fail to abide by these Company policies will face corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. This applies to all employees, including executive officers, senior financial officers, and directors.

This code briefly summarizes the conduct required by key policies and guidelines in effect in the U.S. and abroad and is intended to remind us of the need to act ethically in all we do. Nothing in this code constitutes a contract of employment with any individual.

If you ever are unsure about a situation or a pending decision, contact your supervisor or the others listed at the end of this document. In this way, you can obtain more information about the relevant policy of the Company or report a potential issue. Reports may be made anonymously and LuzFaltex will not allow any retaliation for any information or reports that you provide in good faith.

## Advertising

All of the Company's advertising must be truthful, not deceptive, and comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Company advertising policies. Any claims about the performance or qualities of our products in advertising, sales-training material, and point-of-purchase displays or literature must be substantiated before being made. We will hold ourselves and our competitors to the same high standard when making comparative claims about competing products.

## Antitrust/Competition Laws

LuzFaltex is committed to fair and open competition in markets around the world. All LuzFaltex employees are expected to comply with the antitrust/competition laws of the countries in which we do business. In the U.S., Europe, and many other jurisdictions, it is against the law to agree with competitors on prices or supply levels, division of customers or sales territories, or bids. Violations can result in substantial money damages and criminal penalties for both the company and the individuals involved.

Employees should exercise due care in any situation where competitors may be present to avoid violating these laws. In particular, LuzFaltex employees should not discuss with competitors current or future prices, bids, margins, costs, discounts, rebates, terms of sales, production capacities, supply levels, inventories, customers, business plans, or distribution strategies for competing products or services.

There are other practices such as refusals to deal, price differences to competing resellers, exclusive dealing, programs that affect the prices charged by our resellers, or tying the sale of one product to the customer's purchase of a second product that may also violate these laws. You should always consult with the Legal Department before engaging in discussions with competitors and whenever you have questions about the application of these laws to your business activities.

## Books and Records, Internal Controls, Payments to Government Officials, and Prevention of Money Laundering

All Company financial, accounting, research, test, sales, manufacturing, and expense records or reports, timesheets, and other documents must accurately and clearly represent the facts of the underlying matter. Improper or fraudulent documentation or reporting is contrary to LuzFaltex policy.

LuzFaltex has established accounting and other control standards and procedures to ensure that all Company assets are protected and properly used, and that financial records are accurate and reliable. In addition, LuzFaltex has in place policies governing the receipt of money and processing of payments to ensure compliance with money-laundering prevention laws. Employees should share the responsibility for maintaining and complying with required internal controls and ensuring that Company assets are not misused.

Employees should not make any payments to any government official, either directly or indirectly, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining favorable regulator action. Any other payments made to government officials should be approved in advance and recorded in the Company's financial records.

## Confidential Information

Trade secrets and other proprietary information about LuzFaltex, its business activities, and its customers and suppliers, should be treated as confidential. Except to the extent legally required, such information, or confidential employee data, should not be disclosed to people inside or outside the Company who do not have a legitimate work-related need to know. Any such disclosure must be made in accordance with Company policies and applicable law, including all privacy laws relating to the protection and disclosure of personal data. For more information, see our [privacy-overview.md](privacy policy.md).

In addition to the proper use of information, it is important for employees to prevent misuse, disclosure, or destruction (other than in accordance with the appropriate record retention policy) of the information for which they are responsible. This information may be in printed form, computer-based, or stored on microfilm or some other format. In handling the Company's information or information owned by a third party and/or licensed by the Company, employees should comply with copyright laws, computer software licensing agreements, and Company policy. The Global Information Systems organization can provide advice and assistance in protecting computer-based information in accordance with our information security and privacy policies.

## Conflicts of Interest

Employees are expected to perform their duties in a way that does not conflict with the best interests of LuzFaltex. Employees, and their immediate families, must avoid any action or business relationship that may create a conflict between their own interests and those of LuzFaltex. In other words, employees must not participate in Company decisions by which they may personally benefit. Conflicts of interest include interference, including apparent interference, with the best interests of LuzFaltex as a result of private interest. For example, you may be presented with business opportunities from time to time as a result of your employment or other relationship with LuzFaltex. You should not take for yourself personally any opportunity that you have discovered through the use of corporate property, information, or position for you own personal gain. You should also refrain, directly or indirectly, from competing with LuzFaltex. Employees are required to disclose to management (other than directors, who are required to disclose to the board of directors or a committee thereof) any situation that may be, or appears to be, a conflict of interest. When in doubt, it is best to disclose.

## Diversity and Equal Opportunity

LuzFaltex's future depends on its ability to attract and retain the best people at all levels of the Company. To do that, we must create a working environment that values diversity and protects the right of each employee to fair and equitable treatment. Our policies and practices assure equal employment and advancement opportunities for all qualified people. We will maintain appropriate standards of conduct in the workplace and always be sensitive to the concerns of our diverse group of employees. Harassment of any employee for any reason is inconsistent with LuzFaltex's code of ethics and will not be tolerated. See our [Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy(non-discrimination.md) for more information.

## Environment

LuzFaltex is dedicated to environmental responsibility and will follow all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Where laws do not exist or are inadequate, we will establish and follow our own standards consistent with this commitment to environmental responsibility. Employees have an obligation to promptly alert management to any work-related actions that threaten the environment. For more information, read our [Environment Health and Safety Policy](environment-health-safety.md).

## Gifts and Fair Dealing

Employees should deal honestly and fairly with suppliers, customers, competitors, and employees, and should award LuzFaltex business based on quality, delivery, service, and competitive pricing. To avoid the appearance of improper influence, no employee or member of an employee's immediate family should accept any gift of more than token value. Neither is it appropriate to accept loans or unusual hospitality (excesses in meals, refreshment, or entertainment) from suppliers or customers. Employees should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair dealing practice.

## Political Activities

Generally, neither the Company nor its representatives may make political party or candidate contributions on behalf of the Company except as specifically authorized by the Law and Government Relations Departments, and as permitted under local law. Any such contributions with Company funds require prior approval with the Legal Department. Unless authorized, employees who participate in partisan political activities should not suggest or state that they speak or act for LuzFaltex. Of course, each employee is individually free to pursue political activities they deem appropriate.

## Product Safety

LuzFaltex's objective is to manufacture and market products that are safe for their anticipated use. Employees should immediately report any suspected product safety problem to their supervisor.

## Proper Use of LuzFaltex Assets

All employees should protect LuzFaltex's corporate assets and ensure their efficient use. All assets of the Company should be used for legitimate business purposes.

## Safety and Health

LuzFaltex strives to provide a safe and healthful work setting for all employees. In turn, each employee should encourage and practice safety while on the job and observe appropriate standards of conduct. Employees should immediately notify a supervisor or manager of any work hazards that come to their attention.

## Security Laws and Insider Trading

Under U.S. securities law and the law of several other countries, if an employee knows important, nonpublic information about LuzFaltex or another company, then the employee should not buy or sell any securities (including stock) of LuzFaltex or any other company until the information is generally known to the public. In addition, that employee should not disclose the nonpublic information to others inside or outside LuzFaltex who do not have an obligation to maintain confidentiality. Government agencies are able to monitor trading activities, with violations of this law leading to significant civil and criminal penalties against companies and individuals. In addition, employees who are involved in preparing and reviewing reports and other documents filled with or submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stock exchanges, and other regulators, and press releases and other public communications must strive to provide full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in such materials.


## Support For Our Code of Ethics
